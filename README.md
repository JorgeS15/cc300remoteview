# Engel CC300 Remote View (Windows Script)

This Windows script automates the process of establishing the **Remote View** of an IMM Engel CC300 Control Panel (with and without SSH)

It depends on 
  - PuTTy (if SSH Tunnel is needed)
  - VNC Viewer (to show the IMM screen)


IMM = Injection Molding Machine
